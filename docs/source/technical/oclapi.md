# OCL API

## User Documentation

### API Resources

#### Concepts

The API exposes a representation of `concepts`. Concepts are stored in [[Sources]], such as CIEL, ICD-10, or WHO-IMR. [[Collections]] provide versioned containers of references to concepts across sources.

Concepts have 3 fields that act as sub-resources: `names`, `descriptions`, and `extras`. This allows names, descriptions, and extra metadata to be referenced, viewed, edited, or deleted individually rather than as a whole. These fields are returned with the concept when requesting the full concept details (e.g. `GET /orgs/WHO/sources/ICD-10-2010/concepts/A10.9/`)

##### Concept Shorthand
Concepts are sometimes referred to in shorthand, rather than their fully specified URL:
```
# Get the latest version of a concept
org:source:concept

# Get the concept from a specific version of the source
org:source[sourceVersion]:concept

# Get a specific version of a concept
org:source:concept[conceptVersion]
```
For example, each set points to the same three concepts:
* Fully specified:
    * `/orgs/WHO/sources/ICD-10-2010/concepts/A10.9/`
    * `/orgs/Regenstrief/sources/LOINC/2.43/concepts/32700-7/`
    * `/orgs/MySDO/sources/RainMED/concepts/2962/1d35/`
* Short-hand:
    * `WHO:ICD-10-2010:A10.9`
    * `Regenstrief:LOINC[2.43]:32700-7`
    * `MySDO:RainMED:2962[1d35]`

##### Versioning of concepts
All changes to concepts are tracked internally. The latest version of a concept is retrieved if no version identifier (for the source or concept) is specified. If a source version identifier is specified, then the version of the concept at the time the source version was created is used. Alternatively, specific versions of concepts may also be retrieved.

##### Future Considerations
* Should the standard concept shorthand be changed to refer to the concept of the latest "released" source version instead of the latest version of a concept (regardless of source version)? For example, which url should this shorthand refer to:
    * /orgs/WHO/sources/ICD-10/concepts/A10.9/
    * /orgs/WHO/sources/ICD-10/latest/concepts/A10.9/
* Should "deleting a concept" return the "retired" concept?
* Would be great to allow additional annotation when concepts are retired to indicate to the user which concepts they should use instead. E.g. "retire_reason", "alternative_concepts" fields?



##### Get a single concept from a source
* Get a single concept from a source owned by an organization or user, where an optional `:sourceVersion` is "latest" or a source version ID
```
GET /orgs/:org/sources/:source/[:sourceVersion/]concepts/:concept/
GET /users/:user/sources/:source/[:sourceVersion/]concepts/:concept/
GET /user/sources/:source/[:sourceVersion/]concepts/:concept/
```
* Get a specific version of a concept
```
GET /orgs/:org/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/:conceptVersion/
GET /users/:user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/:conceptVersion/
GET /user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/:conceptVersion/
```
* Parameters
    * **includeMappings** (optional) string - default is "true", which returns direct `mappings` that are contained in the same source as the concept; set to "false" to not return `mappings`
    * **includeInverseMappings** (optional) string - default is "false"; set to "true" to return inverse mappings that are contained in the same source as the concept
* Notes
    * "names", "descriptions", "extras" and "mappings" (within the same source as the concept) are returned in full along with the concept details.
    * Use the `/mappings/` endpoint to retrieve `mappings` for a concept that are defined in other `sources`

##### Example Request
* Get the current version of a concept from the WHO:ICD-10-2010
```
GET /orgs/WHO/sources/ICD-10-2010/concepts/A15.1/?includeInverseMappings=true
```

DELETE /user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/
DELETE /users/:user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/
DELETE /orgs/:org/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/
```
* Parameters
    * **update_comment** (optional) string - text describing the reason for retiring the concept; this field is saved to the concept version

To be implemented
***
* **purge** (optional) string - default is "false"; set to "true" to actually delete the concept from all source versions
* Notes
    * DELETE does not actually delete the concept unless "purge" is set to "true"; a retired concept is a new version of the concept with "retired" set to true, so that by default it is not returned in searches unless specifically requested. The "retired" status also indicates to users that the concept should not be used.

* Status: 204 No Content



##### List versions of a concept
* List all versions of a specific concept
```
GET /user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/versions/
GET /users/:user/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/versions/
GET /orgs/:org/sources/:source/concepts/:concept/versions/
```
* Notes
    * "is_latest_concept_version" is set to `true` if the version is the latest version of the concept
    * "is_root_concept_version" is set to `true` if the version is the initial submission (the "root") of the concept
    * "update_comment" is user-generated text describing the reason for the new version, similar to a GitHub commit comment
* Parameters
    * **verbose** (optional) string - set to true to include the full concept details along with the version metadata

##### Response
* If verbose is "false" (the default), then only the version metadata is returned:

##### Search and Filter Behavior
* Text Search (e.g. `q=criteria`) - NOTE: Plus-sign (+) indicates relative relevancy weight of the term
    * concept.id (++++), concept.names.name (++++), concept.descriptions.description (+)
* Facets
    * **conceptClass** - concept.concept_class
    * **datatype** - concept.datatype
    * **locale** - concept.names.locale
    * **retired** - concept.retired (default=false)
    * **source** - concept.source
    * **owner** - concept.owner
    * **ownerType** - concept.owner_type
* Filters
    * **mapCode** - mapping.to_concept_code, mapping.from_concept_code
* Sort
    * **bestMatch** (default) - see text search fields above
    * **name** (Asc/Desc) - concept.display_name
    * **lastUpdate** (Asc/Desc) - concept.updated_on
    * **id** (Asc/Desc) - concept.id



##### Issues
* "purge" behavior is not yet implemented
* Ability to filter concept search by "mapcode" is not yet implemented.
* Need to update mappings in the concept details to the latest mappings spec
* Currently "display" and "display_locale" are hard coded rather than dynamic attributes set according to the current user's preferences and the concept values.
* Concept details spec has attributes of the count of "stars" and "collections" -- these are not currently implemented.
* Need to confirm implementation of "sortAsc" and "sortDesc"
* Confirm URL parameters
* Need to add method to actually delete a concept, e.g. `DELETE /.../?purge=true`
