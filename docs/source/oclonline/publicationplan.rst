OCL Content Publication Plan
----------------------------

This document outlines OCL’s plans to publish and maintain selected vocabularies in OCL Online. OCL Online is a hosted implementation
of all of OCL’s open-source tools in the cloud and pre-loaded with key terminologies, available at openconceptlab.org.

OCL’s Goal for Content Publication
----------------------------------
OCL aims to publish and maintain key reference vocabularies and other emerging health data standards, especially those that are
important to low and middle income countries. Published content will be available on OCL Online and may also be available for distribution.

How do we keep content up-to-date?
----------------------------------
Each terminology has its own process and schedule for releasing updates. OCL and its partners, Apelon and the Regenstrief Institute,
work actively to keep published content up-to-date. The table below outlines the release process for curated terminologies published in OCL production.

Note that most content available in OCL is managed directly by other users or organizations and thus will have their own release processes.
