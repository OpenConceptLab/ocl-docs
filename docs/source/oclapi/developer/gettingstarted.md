# Getting Started
## Contributing

We welcome all pull requests. Before starting any work, please check https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues if the change you want to work on has been already reported there. If it's not there, create a new issue so that it can be discussed. We should triage the issue and get back to you in a few days.

All pull requests should contain a single commit (unless you have a very good reason to include multiple commits). A commit message should be in the following format: `OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues#id Short title`, where `id` is the issue number e.g. 170. Please always rebase your commit on the master branch and make sure all tests pass, before creating a pull request.

## What you'll need:
* git
* docker-compose
