# Getting Started

## Overview
Here's how a developer gets started contributing to OCL:
1. Create a user account on [OCL Online](https://app.openconceptlab.org)
2. Introduce yourself on [OCL Chat](https://chat.openconceptlab.org)
3. Setup your local development environment (see details below)
4. Claim an "intro" ticket on [OCL's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues) - Assign yourself to the ticket and add a comment
5. Submit a pull request (PR) for the ticket (see details below)
6. Participate in [OCL Dev call](https://openconceptlab.org/ocl-dev-community/)

## Contributing
We welcome all pull requests. Before starting any work, please check [https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues) if the change you want to work on has been already reported there. If it's not there, create a new issue so that it can be discussed. We should triage the issue and get back to you in a few days.

All pull requests should contain a single commit (unless you have a very good reason to include multiple commits). A commit message should be in the following format: `OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues#id Short title`, where `id` is the issue number e.g. 170. Please always rebase your commit on the master branch and make sure all tests pass, before creating a pull request.

## What you'll need
* git
* docker-compose

## Local development environment setup
To setup your local development environment, follow the README.md instructions for the `oclapi2` and `oclweb2` repositories in this order:
